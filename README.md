# Lab-4-Section-2-Reading

## What did I learn about headers?

I learned that there are six deiifferent levels of section hedings.
These levels are represented by <h1>-<h6> elements. 
 <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest level.
 
 This is an example of the code used:
  <h1>Beetles</h1>
    <h2>External morphology</h2>
        <h3>Head</h3>
            <h4>Mouthparts</h4>
        <h3>Thorax</h3>
            <h4>Prothorax</h4>
            <h4>Pterothorax</h4>
